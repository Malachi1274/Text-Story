# [Title] The Random tale of Bull
welcome to the magical world of fairy farts and gum drop dinosaurs,
in this tale, I expect you to NOT EDIT my part of the story.

Somebody once told me the world was gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kinda dumb with her finger and her thumb 
In the shape of an L on her forehead
