# [Title] The Random tale of Bull
welcome to the magical world of fairy farts and gum drop dinosaurs,
in this tale, I expect you to NOT EDIT my part of the story.

Somebody once told me the world was gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kinda dumb with her finger and her thumb 
In the shape of an L on her forehead

I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
I thought love was more or less a giving thing
The more I gave the less I got oh yeah
What's the use in tryin'
All you get is pain
When I wanted sunshine I got rain
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
What's the use of trying
All you get is pain
When I wanted sunshine I got rain
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
Now I'm a believer, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now I'm a believer
Then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
