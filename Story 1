# [Title] The Random tale of Bull
welcome to the magical world of fairy farts and gum drop dinosaurs,
in this tale, I expect you to NOT EDIT my part of the story.

Once upon a time there was an evil wizard called Grumpdrump the Laughable, the people never feared him,
mainly due to him having the name Grumpdrump and an old curse on his magical washing machine that caused it to have an immoveable red sock
that would always turn his whites into pinks and all of his clothes into whites.
