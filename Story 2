Once upon a time

In a lonely tavern on the far side of town
There was once a man called Willy
Who had a mortal enemy called Billy
They worked for a wizard called Grillly but they argued alot 
So they both got sacked before they both lost the plot
And Willy ended up an alcoholic
because he loved his job a whole lot with all the turning people into frogs
and all the flying objects above his head
