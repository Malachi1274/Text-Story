NOTE: All names must rhyme with Willy
Once upon a time

In a lonely tavern on the far side of town
There was once a man called Willy
Who had a mortal enemy called Billy
They worked for a wizard called Grillly but they argued alot 
So they both got the sacked before both lost the plot
The three came from a town called West-Hilly
Billy discoverd the town's barber to get a new job in which Willy got scared
Because he couldn't trust him around sharp objects
From their constant fighting with all the fling of spells Grilly became an alcoholic
